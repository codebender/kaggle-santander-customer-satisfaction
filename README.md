# Kaggle.com - Santander Customer Satisfaction

## Which customers are happy customers?

From frontline support teams to C-suites, customer satisfaction is a key measure of success. Unhappy customers don't stick around. What's more, unhappy customers rarely voice their dissatisfaction before leaving.

[Santander Bank](https://www.santanderbank.com/us/personal) is asking Kagglers to help them identify dissatisfied customers early in their relationship. Doing so would allow Santander to take proactive steps to improve a customer's happiness before it's too late.

In this competition, you'll work with hundreds of anonymized features to predict if a customer is satisfied or dissatisfied with their banking experience.
